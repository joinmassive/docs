## Example code

```swift
import Massive

...

MSVInit(apiToken: apiToken, completion: { (massive: MSVNode?, error: Error?) -> Void in
  if massive != nil {
    massive.userOptedIn = true

    massive.menuBarUsageShown = true

    if massive.menuBarUsageShown {
      massive.menuBarUsageShown = false
    }

    let massiveViewController = massive.createUsageViewController()
    view.addSubview(massiveViewController.view)

    massive.pauseUsage(timePeriod: .hour)

    if massive.usagePaused {
      massive.unpauseUsage()
    }

    if massive.userOptedIn {
      massive.userOptedIn = false
    }
  }
} as! MSVInitCompletionHandler)
```

## Getting started

1.  Download the [latest SDK package][5].
2.  Open the Xcode project you want to integrate the SDK into.
3.  If your project navigator isn't shown, go to **View** > **Navigators** >
    **Show Project Navigator**.
4.  Open the SDK package and drag the `Massive.framework` bundle into the
    navigator.
5.  If the **Copy items if needed** box and box for your app target aren't
    checked, check them.
6.  Press the **Finish** button.
7.  In the implementation file for your app delegate, import the SDK:

    ```swift
    // Importing in Swift:
    import Massive
    ```

8.  In your `applicationDidFinishLaunching` method, start and wait till the SDK
    is ready by calling the `MSVInit` function and defining a
    `MSVInitCompletionHandler` block:

    ```swift
    // Starting in Swift:
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
      ...

      MSVInit(apiToken: apiToken, completion: { (massive: MSVNode?, error: Error?) -> Void in
        if massive != nil {
          ...
        }
      } as! MSVInitCompletionHandler)

      ...
    }
    ```

9.  When the user opts in, toggle the `userOptedIn` property on:

    ```swift
    // Opting in in Swift:
    massive.userOptedIn = true
    ```

10. Next, show user tooling by toggling the `menuBarUsageShown` property on on
    demand or calling the `getUsageViewController` method then adding the view
    of the returned controller to your interface:

    ```swift
    // Showing system tooling in Swift:
    massive.menuBarUsageShown = true

    // Showing custom tooling in Swift:
    let massiveViewController = massive.createUsageViewController()
    view.addSubview(massiveViewController.view)
    ```

See the [API reference][6] for detailed info and optional SDK functionality.

## Sample apps

See the `README.txt` file and `Massive Sample` folder in the [SDK package][7].

## API reference

### Protocol

**`MSVNode`**

Defines a node of the Massive distributed computer.

---

### Types

**`typealias MSVInitCompletionHandler = (MSVNode?, Error?) -> Void`**

A block called asynchronously after a Massive node has been started. The node,
if started successfully, or startup error, if not, is passed to the block.

---

**`enum MSVTimePeriod: Int`**

A capped or uncapped duration.

**Cases**

**`case indefinite`** An indefinite time period.

**`case hour`** An hour.

**`case day`** A day.

**`case week`** A week.

---

### Functions

**`func MSVInit(apiToken: String, completion: MSVInitCompletionHandler)`**

Starts a Massive node, pending user opt-in, attributed to your API token.

**Parameters**

**`apiToken`** A unique developer identifier obtained from this website.

**`completion`** A block called asynchronously after node startup.

---

### Properties

**`var userOptedIn: Bool { get set }`**

The state of user opt-in. `true` allows computing resources to be
opportunistically consumed; `false` doesn't. Resource consumption is disallowed
by default; the user must agree to easy-to-understand terms of the exchange
you're offering before you toggle this property on.

---

**`var usagePaused: Bool { get }`**

The enablement state of resource consumption. `true` indicates usage is paused;
`false`, unpaused.

---

**`var menuBarUsageShown: Bool { get set }`**

The visibility state of menu-bar tooling. `true` adds charts representing
resource consumption to the user's menu bar; `false` removes them. Resource
charts aren't made available by default; they must be added to the menu bar by
toggling this property on or to your interface by calling the
`createUsageViewController` method.

---

### Methods

**`func pauseUsage(timePeriod: MSVTimePeriod)`**

Disables opportunistic resource consumption for the finite time period or till
you call the `unpauseUsage` method. Resource consumption is enabled by default.

**Parameters**

**`timePeriod`** A capped or uncapped duration.

---

**`func unpauseUsage()`**

Re-enables resource consumption if disabled.

---

**`func createUsageViewController() -> NSViewController`**

Constructs a view controller with charts representing resource consumption that
you can add to your app's interface. Resource charts must be added to your
interface by calling this method or to the menu bar by toggling the
`menuBarUsageShown` property on.

**Return value**

The view controller with resource charts.
