# About Us

Your users who opt in pay with an imperceptible amount of their computing power and bandwidth rather than with their personal attention and data.

Massive combines these computing resources to form a supercomputer that monitors internet performance, gathers business intelligence, trains AI models, runs scientific simulations, and performs other distributed tasks. You can access your developer dashboard anytime to check the daily revenue you’ve generated.

The SDK takes care of performing tasks imperceptibly by analyzing anonymous telemetry data. You’re responsible for making sure users are prompted with clear terms before opting in then can pause, opt out of, and access tooling to visualize resource consumption.
