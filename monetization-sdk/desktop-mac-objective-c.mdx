## Example code

```objectivec
#import <Massive/Massive.h>

...

MSVInitWithAPIToken(apiToken, ^(id<MSVNode> massive, NSError *error) {
  if (massive) {
    massive.userOptedIn = YES;

    massive.menuBarUsageShown = YES;
    if (massive.menuBarUsageShown) massive.menuBarUsageShown = NO;

    NSViewController *massiveViewController = [massive createUsageViewController];
    [view addSubview:massiveViewController.view];

    [massive pauseUsageForTimePeriod:MSVHour];
    if (massive.usagePaused) [massive unpauseUsage];

    if (massive.userOptedIn) massive.userOptedIn = NO;
  }
});
```

## Getting started

1.  Download the [latest SDK package][5].
2.  Open the Xcode project you want to integrate the SDK into.
3.  If your project navigator isn’t shown, go to **View** > **Navigators** >
    **Show Project Navigator**.
4.  Open the SDK package and drag the `Massive.framework` bundle into the
    navigator.
5.  If the **Copy items if needed** box and box for your app target aren’t
    checked, check them.
6.  Press the **Finish** button.
7.  In the implementation file for your app delegate, import the SDK:

    ```objectivec
    // Importing in Objective-C:
    #import <Massive/Massive.h>
    ```

8.  In your `applicationDidFinishLaunching` method, start and wait till the SDK
    is ready by calling the `MSVInitWithAPIToken` function and defining a
    `MSVInitCompletionHandler` block:

    ```objectivec
    // Starting in Objective-C:
    - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)notification {
      ...

      MSVInitWithAPIToken(apiToken, ^(id<MSVNode> massive, NSError *error) {
        if (massive) {
          ...
        }
      });

      ...
    }
    ```

9.  When the user opts in, toggle the `userOptedIn` property on:

    ```objectivec
    // Opting in in Objective-C:
    massive.userOptedIn = YES;
    ```

10. Next, show user tooling by toggling the `menuBarUsageShown` property on on
    demand or calling the `getUsageViewController` method then adding the view
    of the returned controller to your interface:

    ```objectivec
    // Showing system tooling in Objective-C:
    massive.menuBarUsageShown = YES;

    // Showing custom tooling in Objective-C:
    NSViewController *massiveViewController = [massive createUsageViewController];
    [view addSubview:massiveViewController.view];
    ```

See the [API reference][6] for detailed info and optional SDK functionality.

## Sample apps

See the `README.txt` file and `Massive Sample` folder in the [SDK package][7].

## API reference

### Protocol

**`MSVNode`**

Defines a node of the Massive distributed computer.

---

### Types

**`typedef void (^MSVInitCompletionHandler)(id<MSVNode> node, NSError *error);`**

A block called asynchronously after a Massive node has been started. The node,
if started successfully, or startup error, if not, is passed to the block.

---

**`typedef enum MSVTimePeriod: NSInteger { ... } MSVTimePeriod;`**

A capped or uncapped duration.

**Cases**

**`MSVIndefinite`** An indefinite time period.

**`MSVHour`** An hour.

**`MSVDay`** A day.

**`MSVWeek`** A week.

---

### Functions

**`void MSVInitWithAPIToken(NSString *apiToken, MSVInitCompletionHandler completion);`**

Starts a Massive node, pending user opt-in, attributed to your API token.

**Parameters**

**`apiToken`** A unique developer identifier obtained from this website.

**`completion`** A block called asynchronously after node startup.

---

### Properties

**`@property BOOL userOptedIn;`**

The state of user opt-in. `YES` allows computing resources to be
opportunistically consumed; `NO` doesn’t. Resource consumption is disallowed by
default; the user must agree to easy-to-understand terms of the exchange you’re
offering before you toggle this property on.

---

**`@property(readonly) BOOL usagePaused;`**

The enablement state of resource consumption. `YES` indicates usage is paused;
`NO`, unpaused.

---

**`@property BOOL menuBarUsageShown;`**

The visibility state of menu-bar tooling. `YES` adds charts representing
resource consumption to the user’s menu bar; `NO` removes them. Resource charts
aren’t made available by default; they must be added to the menu bar by toggling
this property on or to your interface by calling the `createUsageViewController`
method.

---

### Methods

**`- (void)pauseUsageForTimePeriod:(MSVTimePeriod)timePeriod;`**

Disables opportunistic resource consumption for the finite time period or till
you call the `unpauseUsage` method. Resource consumption is enabled by default.

**Parameters**

**`timePeriod`** A capped or uncapped duration.

---

**`- (void)unpauseUsage;`**

Re-enables resource consumption if disabled.

---

**`- (NSViewController *)createUsageViewController;`**

Constructs a view controller with charts representing resource consumption that
you can add to your app’s interface. Resource charts must be added to your
interface by calling this method or to the menu bar by toggling the
`menuBarUsageShown` property on.

**Return value**

The view controller with resource charts.
