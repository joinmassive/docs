# Prerequisites

- Your API key for the Proxy Resellers API
- cURL or any HTTP client (like Postman)

# Step 1: Verify Your API Key

First, let's check if your API key is working:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api-network.joinmassive.com/resellers/accounts' \
--header 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'
```

If successful, you should receive a list of existing accounts or an empty array.

# Step 2: Create a New Account

Let's create a new reseller account:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api-network.joinmassive.com/resellers/accounts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
--data '{
  "username": "newreseller@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "limit": 1000000
}'
```

If successful, you'll receive a response with the new account's ID.

# Step 3: Retrieve Account Details

Now, let's fetch the details of the account we just created:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api-network.joinmassive.com/resellers/accounts/{account_id}' \
--header 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'
```

Replace {account_id} with the ID received in Step 2.
