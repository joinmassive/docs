# Getting started

We’ll use `curl` for our API call examples. You could also consider a dedicated tool for developing API requests (like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)).

# Authenticate

You’ll need a [session token](https://www.metabase.com/glossary/session_token) to authenticate your requests, or Metabase will refuse to talk with you. To get a session token, submit a request to the [/api/session](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/api/session) endpoint with your username and password:

```bash
curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"username": "{METABASE_EMAIL}", "password": "{METABASE_PASSWORD}"}' \
      https://massive.metabaseapp.com/api/session
```

<Info>
  **Attention:** Your Metabase email and password are different than the credentials used to sign in to Massive's Partner Portal.
</Info>

This request will return a JSON object with a key called `ID` and the token as the key’s value, e.g.

```
{ "id": "38f4939c-ad7f-4cbe-ae54-30946daf8593" }
```

You’ll need to include that session token in the headers of your subsequent requests like this:

```
"X-Metabase-Session": "38f4939c-ad7f-4cbe-ae54-30946daf8593"
```

Some things to note about sessions:

- By default, sessions are good for **14 days**.
- You should cache credentials to reuse them until they expire because logins are rate-limited for security.
- Invalid and expired session tokens return a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.
- Handle 401 status codes gracefully. We recommend writing your code to fetch a new session token and automatically retry a request when the API returns a `401 status code`.

# Read any card

The reporting API builds on your dashboard view. You can query any data in your dashboard via the API with the command below:

_Note: If there is data you’d like to query that is not in your dashboard please reach out to your contact at Massive via Slack or Email._

```bash
curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Metabase-Session: 38f4939c-ad7f-4cbe-ae54-30946daf8593" \
      https://massive.metabaseapp.com/api/card/484/query/json
```

You simply need to replace the session ID with your from the authentication step and the card ID from your dashboard:

```
X-Metabase-Session: 38f4939c-ad7f-4cbe-ae54-30946daf8593
```

You can find the card ID in the URL of the card. In the example below that would be `484`:

_Note: You must open a specific card and you should not use the ID of the whole dashboard._
