## Introduction

The search service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&zwj;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search**.

Searches are performed in real time by default or can be queued for
[later retrieval](#asynchronous-mode). Real-time searches take an average of a few seconds but may
require multiple retries, in which case up to **120 seconds** is allocated per API request.

### Authentication

You can access the service by including
[your secret API token](https://partners.joinmassive.com/profile) in an `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer [Insert API token here]
```

Here’s an example request that uses the [common Curl command](https://curl.se/):

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"          \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search?terms=foo'
```

### Search parameters

Required and optional parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values that Massive supports are as follows:

| Key           | Required | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `subaccount`  | ⬜       | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters (regardless of character encoding); Massive will bill requests made from subaccounts separately                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Device emulation

The `device` parameter (which is currently limited to Google searches) lets you fetch
device-specific results, rather than the default desktop results. For a list of supported smartphone
and tablet devices, make a request with your API token and no parameters to
**https://&zwj;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/devices**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"        \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/devices'
```

The API will return JSON that contains an alphabetized array of device names:

```json
[
  "BlackBerry Z30",
  "BlackBerry Z30 landscape",
  "Galaxy Note 3",
  "[Remaining device names here]"
]
```

### Asynchronous mode

A search request that includes the `mode=async` key-value pair will be satisfied asynchronously:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                     \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search?terms=foo&mode=async'
```

In response, the API will provide a JSON job identifier:

```json
{ "id": "078fd246-f0f7-44a0-aabb-cadd7b12454f" }
```

The job results or status can be requested at any time thereafter by passing a token and the
identifier to **https://&zwj;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/results**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                                                \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/results?id=078fd246-f0f7-44a0-aabb-cadd7b12454f'
```

The results, if ready, will be returned in the
[same format as synchronous results](#response-format); otherwise, a JSON status message will be
returned.

A `retrieving` status indicates that the search is in progress:

```json
{ "status": "retrieving" }
```

A `failed` status indicates that the search was unsuccessful and the request should be retried:

```json
{ "status": "failed" }
```

### Response format

You can receive search results in their original HTML or as structured JSON.

#### HTML

Google and Bing don’t feature infinite scrolling, so if you request more than one results page from
those search engines, the HTML of each page will be separated from the next by an empty line
(`\n\n`).

#### JSON

If you set the output to JSON, your results will be parsed into nested objects as in the following
example:

```json
{
               "query": "foo",
  "approxResultsCount": 255000000,
        "resultsCount": 43,
