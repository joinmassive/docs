## Overview

The Domain Blocklist feature allows users to block specific domains directly from the Massive Dashboard. This provides greater control over browsing restrictions without requiring API calls or admin intervention.

> **Note:** Only exact domain matches are blocked. Wildcards, subdomains, and path-based blocking (e.g., `sub.example.com` or `example.com/path`) are not yet supported.

## Key Features

- Add or remove domains to your personal blocklist
- Upload multiple domains at once using CSV
- Search, filter, and manage up to 1,000 blocked domains
- Remove domains individually or clear the entire blocklist
- Applied instantly to your proxy connections

## Getting Started

To manage your blocklist:

1. Log in to your **Massive Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Domain Blocklist** in the left-hand menu
3. The panel will display your current list of blocked domains and available management options

## Adding Domains

1. Enter the domain you want to block in the **Enter domain** field (e.g., `ads.trackerexample.net`)
2. Click **Add**
3. The domain will immediately appear in your blocklist

## Bulk Upload CSV

1. Click **Bulk Upload CSV** to add multiple domains at once
2. Each domain should be listed on a separate line in the file

## Managing Your Blocklist

- **Search domains** – Quickly locate entries in your blocklist
- **Pagination** – Adjust the number of rows displayed per page
- **Remove a domain** – Use the delete action next to any domain to remove it
- **Remove all** – Use the **Remove All** button to clear your blocklist completely

## Example Domains

Your blocklist might include:

```
ads.trackerexample.net
malicious-domain.test
phishing-site.demo
untrusted-proxy.biz
metrics-data.example.org
```

## Best Practices

- **Start small** – Block only essential domains first
- **Use CSV for efficiency** – Upload larger lists when needed
- **Review regularly** – Keep your blocklist updated to match your use case
- **Verify restrictions** – Test blocked domains after updating your list

## Limitations

- Each user can only manage their own blocklist
- Admins may apply global blocklists that override personal settings
- The maximum number of blocked domains per account is 1,000
- **Wildcards are not supported** – Only exact domains on the list will be blocked. Subdomains (e.g., `sub.example.com`) and paths (e.g., `example.com/path`) will not be blocked unless explicitly added.
