### Quick Fix: Proxy Settings Not Updating in Your Browser?
When modifying proxy settings in browser-based proxy management tools such as **SwitchyOmega** or **FoxyProxy**, you may encounter an issue where your browser continues to use the old configuration, even after saving the new settings. 

This often happens when switching locations, adjusting sticky sessions, or updating other proxy options. 

Fortunately, this is a common issue and can be easily resolved with a simple fix.

ðŸ’¡ Here's what you need to do:
1. Open **SwitchyOmega** or **FoxyProxy**.
2. Update your proxy settings to your desired configuration.
3. Save the changes to apply them.
4. **Restart your browser** â€” this step is crucial as it clears the cached settings and ensures the browser uses the updated proxy.
5. Double-check your new settings using any IP lookup site.

This process applies to all browser-based proxy managers, not just specific tools. No complex fixes are required; a simple browser restart does the trick.
