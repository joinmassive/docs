title: "Exit IP Headers"
description: "Exit IP address automatically included in CONNECT response headers for HTTPS traffic."

## Overview

The `X-Exit-IP` header is automatically included in the HTTP 200 OK response to CONNECT requests, providing visibility into which exit IP will be used for tunneled connections (HTTPS traffic).

## HTTP vs HTTPS Proxy Behavior

### Plain HTTP Traffic
For plain HTTP requests, the proxy directly forwards your request to the target server and returns the response. No CONNECT request is used, and therefore no `X-Exit-IP` header is available.

### HTTPS Traffic (with CONNECT)
For HTTPS traffic, a tunnel must be established first:

1. Your client sends a CONNECT request to the proxy asking to establish a tunnel to the target server
2. The proxy responds with HTTP 200 OK including the `X-Exit-IP` header
3. After receiving the 200 OK, your client sends the actual HTTPS traffic through this tunnel
4. The tunnel ensures your HTTPS traffic remains encrypted end-to-end between your client and the target server

## How It Works

When your client sends a CONNECT request to establish an HTTPS tunnel:

```bash
CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:443
Proxy-Authorization: Basic {credentials}
```

The proxy responds with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Exit-IP: 203.0.113.42

```

This header tells you which exit IP will be used for the tunneled connection before any actual HTTPS data is sent through the tunnel.

## Availability

The `X-Exit-IP` header:
- Is automatically included in all CONNECT responses (HTTPS traffic only)
- Shows the actual IP that will be used for the tunneled connection
- Is not available for plain HTTP requests (which don't use CONNECT)

## Example Usage

### With curl

```bash
curl -x https://network.joinmassive.com:65535 \
     -U '{PROXY_USERNAME}:{API_KEY}' \
     -v https://example.com
```

In verbose mode, you'll see:

```
* CONNECT tunnel established, response 200
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Exit-IP: 203.0.113.42
```
