Usage alerts help you stay informed when your usage reaches a certain threshold.
You can set up alerts to receive notifications via email, ensuring you never exceed
your desired limits. Follow these simple steps to configure and manage your alerts.

**Note**:

- You can create up to **10 alerts per account**. If you need more, please contact our team.
- Alerts apply **within a single billing cycle**. For example, if you set an alert for 10GB, use 9GB, and your plan renews, using 1GB more in the new cycle will not trigger the previous alert.
- Alerts are processed asynchronously, so they may trigger with a slight delay after requests to Massive Proxy are made

## Create a New Alert
