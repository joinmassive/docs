title: "Exit Node Headers"
description: "Exit node metadata automatically included in CONNECT response headers for HTTPS traffic."

## Overview

Exit node headers are automatically included in the HTTP 200 OK response to CONNECT requests, providing visibility into the exit node properties that will be used for tunneled connections (HTTPS traffic). These headers include the exit IP address, country, timezone, and ASN information.

## HTTP vs HTTPS Proxy Behavior

### Plain HTTP Traffic
For plain HTTP requests, the proxy directly forwards your request to the target server and returns the response. No CONNECT request is used, and therefore no `X-Exit-IP` header is available.

### HTTPS Traffic (with CONNECT)
For HTTPS traffic, a tunnel must be established first:

1. Your client sends a CONNECT request to the proxy asking to establish a tunnel to the target server
2. The proxy responds with HTTP 200 OK including the `X-Exit-IP` header
3. After receiving the 200 OK, your client sends the actual HTTPS traffic through this tunnel
4. The tunnel ensures your HTTPS traffic remains encrypted end-to-end between your client and the target server

## How It Works

When your client sends a CONNECT request to establish an HTTPS tunnel:

```bash
CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:443
Proxy-Authorization: Basic {credentials}
```

The proxy responds with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Exit-IP: 203.0.113.42
X-Exit-Country: US
X-Exit-Timezone: America/New_York
X-Exit-ASN: 7922

```

These headers provide information about the exit node before any actual HTTPS data is sent through the tunnel.

## Available Headers

### X-Exit-IP
- **Description**: The IP address of the exit node
- **Format**: IPv4 or IPv6 address
- **Example**: `X-Exit-IP: 203.0.113.42`
- **Availability**: Always included in CONNECT responses

### X-Exit-Country
- **Description**: Two-letter country code of the exit node location
- **Format**: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
- **Example**: `X-Exit-Country: US`
- **Availability**: Included when geo data is available

### X-Exit-Timezone
- **Description**: IANA timezone identifier of the exit node location
- **Format**: IANA timezone string
- **Example**: `X-Exit-Timezone: America/New_York`
- **Availability**: Included when geo data is available

### X-Exit-ASN
- **Description**: Autonomous System Number of the exit node's network
- **Format**: Unsigned integer
- **Example**: `X-Exit-ASN: 7922`
- **Availability**: Included when ASN data is available

## Availability

Exit node headers:
- Are automatically included in all CONNECT responses (HTTPS traffic only)
- Provide information about the exit node before the tunnel is established
- Are not available for plain HTTP requests (which don't use CONNECT)

## Example Usage

### With curl

```bash
curl -x https://network.joinmassive.com:65535 \
     -U '{PROXY_USERNAME}:{API_KEY}' \
     -v https://example.com
```

In verbose mode, you'll see:

```
* CONNECT tunnel established, response 200
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Exit-IP: 203.0.113.42
< X-Exit-Country: US
< X-Exit-Timezone: America/New_York
< X-Exit-ASN: 7922
```

## Use Cases

Exit node headers are useful for:

- **Logging and Debugging**: Track which exit nodes are being used for each request
- **Compliance**: Verify that traffic is exiting from expected geographic locations
- **Analytics**: Analyze exit node distribution and performance
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify patterns in exit node selection for debugging purposes
