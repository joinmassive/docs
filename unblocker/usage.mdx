### Report parameters

You should specify an ISO date or time range to generate a report:

<Datetimes />

The API will return a JSON array:

```json
[{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "from": "2025-12-25T00:00:00+00:00",
  "to": "2025-12-25T15:00:00+00:00",
  "service": "browser",
  "result": "success",
  "calls": 17208,
  "meanSecs": 6.78
}, {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "from": "2025-12-25T01:00:00+00:00",
  "to": "2025-12-25T15:00:00+00:00",
  "service": "browser",
  "result": "failure",
  "calls": 18,
  "meanSecs": 60.22
}]
```

Your report can optionally be filtered by one or more services:
