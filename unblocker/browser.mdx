## Service usage

**{companyName}'s** browser service navigates intelligently on your behalf, rendering JavaScript,
solving [captchas](https://www.ibm.com/topics/captcha), and retrying failed requests. The service
has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&zwj;{apiEndpoint}/browser**.

Webpages can be localized with <Link href='geotargeting'>geotargeting parameters</Link>. They're
retrieved in real time by default or optionally queued for <Link href='scheduling'>subsequent
retrieval</Link>. Up to **3 minutes** is allotted per real-time API call to accommodate
captcha-solving, multiple retries, and other mitigations. <Link href='usage'>Usage data</Link> is
published regularly.

<Tip>
  If a site you're targeting remains blocked, even with different browsing params, <a
  href={`mailto:${emailAddress}`}>let us know</a>. We can usually help unblock any site within **48
  hours**.

### Browsing parameters

Besides the [geotargeting and scheduling params](#usage) linked above, required and optional
browsing params can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values **{companyName}** supports are as follows:

| Key          | Required | Premium | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `url`        | ✅       | ⬜      | The URL of the page to browse; any unsafe characters require [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding)                                                                                                     |
| `difficulty` | ⬜       | ✅      | The difficulty pool to attempt to access the URL from, `low`, `medium`, or `high` (coming soon); `low` is the default difficulty                                                                                                                    |
| `speed`      | ⬜       | ✅      | The speed to attempt to access the URL at, `light`, `ridiculous`, or `ludicrous` (planned), where `ridiculous` is 30 percent faster on average than `light` speed; `light` is the default speed                                                     |
| `device`     | ⬜       | ⬜      | The name as returned by the [devices resource](#device-emulation) of the device to emulate browsing on (these names are case insensitive but must include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); device emulation is unused by default |
| `ip`         | ⬜       | ⬜      | The type of IP address to browse from, `residential`, `isp`, or `datacenter` (planned); a random IP type is used by default                                                                                                                         |
| `captcha`    | ⬜       | ⬜      | The intended resolution of any detected captcha, `solved`, `ignored`, or `rejected`, where `rejected` results in a `403` response; `solved` is the default captcha resolution                                                                       |
| `readiness`  | ⬜       | ⬜      | The standard ready event to await before snapshotting browsed content, `load` or `domcontentloaded`; `load` is the default ready event                                                                                                              |

### Device emulation

The `device` param lets you fetch device-specific content, rather than the default desktop content.
For a list of supported smartphone and tablet devices, make a request with your API token and no
params to **https://&zwj;{apiEndpoint}/browser/devices**:

<Devices />

The API will return JSON that contains an alphabetized array of device names:

```json
[
  "Blackberry PlayBook",
  "Blackberry PlayBook landscape",
  "BlackBerry Z30",
  "[Remaining device names here]"
]
```

Then, pass your device name of choice in to your browsing request:

<Device />

### Sticky sessions

To reuse a browser session across requests, set a cookie named `session`:

<Session />

The cookie value can be any unique identifier of up to **255 characters** (regardless of character
encoding) and **{companyName}** will make best efforts to route calls in the same session to the
same egress node for up to **12 minutes**.

### Response format

Pages are returned as rendered HTML, raw (unrendered) HTML, or Markdown optimized for LLM prompts.
