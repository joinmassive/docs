## Service usage

**{companyName}'s** search service delivers all organic and paid result types from popular search
engines, reliably, as structured or raw data. The service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET`
requests at **https://&zwj;{apiEndpoint}/search**.

Searches can be localized with <Link href='geotargeting'>geotargeting parameters</Link>. They're
performed live by default or optionally queued for <Link href='scheduling'>subsequent
retrieval</Link>. Live searches take an average of a few seconds but may require multiple retries,
in which case up to **3 minutes** is allocated per API call. <Link href='usage'>Usage data</Link> is
published regularly.

### Response format

Search results are returned as rendered HTML or structured JSON.

#### HTML

If you request multiple results pages that don't feature infinite scrolling, the HTML of each page
will be separated from the next by an empty line (`\n\n`).

#### JSON

If you set the output to JSON, your results will be parsed into nested objects.
