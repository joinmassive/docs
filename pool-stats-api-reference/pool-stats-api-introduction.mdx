description: 'The Pool Stats API provides real-time statistics about the node pool availability.'
---

# Key Features

- Get live node pool statistics with filtering
- Group results by various dimensions (country, city, ASN, ZIP, pool type, device type)
- Retrieve available server regions

# Important Disclaimer

<Warning>
The node counts returned by the Pool Stats API are **not** the number of nodes that will be available to serve requests.

**Rule of thumb:** For reliable geo-targeting, we recommend having at least **1,000 nodes** in the specified geographic area.

**Note:** The more specific the geographic targeting (e.g., city or ZIP code level), the less accurate the counts become and the higher the chance of receiving a 521 error, even if the Pool Stats API shows nodes available for that location.
</Warning>
