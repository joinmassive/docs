title: "Scrapy (for Python)"
description: "After installing Scrapy (`pip install scrapy`) and creating a project (`scrapy startproject [project name]`), you can connect to the Massive Network by saving code like that below to a file in the new `[project name]/[project name]/spiders` subdirectory then running `scrapy crawl demo` from the top-level `[project name]` directory (Scrapy doesn’t seem to support HTTPS proxy connections, but you can use the [network’s HTTP port](/isp-proxies/authentication#http)):"

```python
import scrapy
import urllib

class Demo(scrapy.Spider):
  name = 'demo'

  def parse(self, response):
    print(response.body)

  def start_requests(self):
    username = '{PROXY_USERNAME}'
    password = '{API_KEY}'
    url      = 'https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace' # Insert your target URL here
    host     = 'isp.joinmassive.com'
    port     = 4080
    proxy    = f'http://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}'

    yield scrapy.Request(url, callback=self.parse, meta={'proxy': proxy})
```
