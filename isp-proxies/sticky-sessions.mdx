## Using Sticky Sessions:

| Key     | Value                                         | Duration      | Examples           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| session | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters | No expiration | 0, abc, session123 |

Add a session identifier to keep your requests on the same IP address:

```bash
curl --proxy http://isp.joinmassive.com:4080 -U '{PROXY_USERNAME}-session-37:{API_KEY}' ip-api.com
```

When using sticky sessions:

1. The first request with a session ID linked to a specific IP address.

2. All subsequent requests with the same session ID will use that same IP address.

3. Sessions continue indefinitely unless the session identifier is changed.

4. Requests that do not have a session ID will automatically be assigned a new IP address.
