- **Limited Ports:** Only standard ports (80, 443) are available.
    - Allowed: `http://example.com/`, `https://example.com/`

- **Content Policy:** The ISP proxy network is designed for activities falling within the legal framework of all jurisdictions. Requests targeting high-risk, offensive, harmful, or illegal content may be blocked.

Requests blocked due to protocol, port, or content restrictions return a `452 Disallowed Content` error.
