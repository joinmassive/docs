## Usage

The “superagent” service browses intelligently on your behalf, rendering JavaScript, solving
[CAPTCHAs](https://www.ibm.com/topics/captcha), and retrying failed requests along the way. The
service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent**.

Webpages are retrieved in real time by default or can be queued up for
[later retrieval](#asynchronous-mode). Up to **120 seconds** is allotted per real-time API request
to accommodate CAPTCHA-solving, multiple retries, and other mitigations.

### Authentication

You can access the service by including
[your secret API token](https://partners.joinmassive.com/profile) in an `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer [Insert API token here]
```

Here’s an example request that uses the [common Curl command](https://curl.se/):

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                             \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent?url=https://example.com/'
```

### Request parameters

Required and optional parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values that Massive supports are as follows:

| Key           | Required | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`         | ✅       | The URL of the page to browse; any unsafe characters require [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding)                                                                                                                               |
| `device`      | ⬜       | The name as returned by the [devices endpoint](#device-emulation) of the device to emulate browsing on (these names are case insensitive but required to include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); device emulation is unused by default                    |
| `country`     | ⬜       | The [two-letter ISO code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code) of the country to browse from (these codes are case insensitive); a random country will be used by default                                                                                                 |
| `subdivision` | ⬜       | The alphanumeric second part (proceeding the separator) of a [first-level subdivision code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code) in the (prerequisite) country to browse from (these codes are case insensitive); a random subdivision will be used by default            |
| `city`        | ⬜       | The [commonly spelled name](https://www.geonames.org/) of the city in the (prerequisite) country to browse from (these names are temporarily case sensitive and required to include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); a random city will be used by default |
| `mode`        | ⬜       | The synchronous or asynchronous timing of when to retrieve the page, `sync` or `async` (see [details below](#asynchronous-mode)); `sync` is the default mode                                                                                                                  |
| `expiration`  | ⬜       | The maximum age of a cached page in days to accept, where `0` will disable caching; `1` is the default number of days                                                                                                                                                         |
| `session`     | ⬜       | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters (regardless of character encoding); Massive will make best efforts to route requests in the same session to the same egress node                                                                                                |
| `subaccount`  | ⬜       | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters (regardless of character encoding); Massive will bill requests made from subaccounts separately                                                                                                                                 |

### Device emulation

The `device` parameter lets you fetch device-specific responses. For a list of supported devices,
make a request with your API token and no parameters to
**https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent/devices**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"            \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent/devices'
```

The API will return JSON that contains an alphabetized array of device names:

```json
[
  "Blackberry PlayBook",
  "Blackberry PlayBook landscape",
  "BlackBerry Z30",
  "[Remaining device names here]"
]
```

### Asynchronous mode

A request that includes the `mode=async` key-value pair will be satisfied asynchronously:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                                        \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent?url=https://example.com/&mode=async'
```

In return, the API will provide a JSON job identifier:

```json
{ "id": "1851dab8-4619-409f-893f-47dd3a180bc3" }
```

The job response or status can be requested at any time thereafter by passing a token and the
identifier to **https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent/results**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                                                    \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent/results?id=1851dab8-4619-409f-893f-47dd3a180bc3'
```

The response, if ready, will be returned in the
[same format as a synchronous response](#response-specification); otherwise, a JSON status message
will be returned.

A `retrieving` status indicates that the fetch is in progress:

```json
{ "status": "retrieving" }
```

A `failed` status indicates that the fetch was unsuccessful and the request should be retried:

```json
{ "status": "failed" }
```

### Response specification

Pages are returned in their rendered HTML.

```

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                                                        \
