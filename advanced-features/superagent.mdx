## Usage

The “superagent” service browses intelligently on your behalf, rendering JavaScript, solving
[CAPTCHAs](https://www.ibm.com/topics/captcha), and retrying failed requests along the way. The
service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent**.

Webpages are retrieved in real time by default or can be queued up for
[later retrieval](#asynchronous-mode). Up to **120 seconds** is allotted per real-time API request
to accommodate CAPTCHA-solving, multiple retries, and other mitigations.

### Authentication

You can access the service by including
[your secret API token](https://partners.joinmassive.com/profile) in an `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer [Insert API token here]
```

Here’s an example request that uses the [common Curl command](https://curl.se/):

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                             \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/superagent?url=https://example.com/'
```

### Response format

Page responses are returned as rendered HTML.
