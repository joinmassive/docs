title: 'SERP API'
description: 'Extract real-time results from popular search engines.'
---

## Usage

The search service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search**. Searches are performed in real time and
may require multiple retries, so allot up to **120 seconds** per response.

## Authentication

Access the service by including [your secret API token](/profile) in an `Authorization`
header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
```

## Parameters

Required and optional parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values that Massive supports are as follows:

## Response specification

You can receive search results in their original HTML format or as structured JSON.

### HTML

Google on mobile devices and Bing don’t feature infinite scrolling, so if you request more than one
results page from those search engines, the HTML of each page will be separated from the next by an
empty line (`\n\n`).

### JSON

If you set the output to JSON, your results will be parsed into an ordered array of result objects
having the following keys:

```json
[{
      "url": "[First URL here]",
    "title": "[First title here]",
  "snippet": "[First snippet here]"
}, {
      "url": "[Second URL here]",
    "title": "[Second title here]",
  "snippet": "[Second snippet here]"
}, {
      "url": "[Third URL here]",
    "title": "[Third title here]",
  "snippet": "[Third snippet here]"
}, "[Remaining results here]"]
```
