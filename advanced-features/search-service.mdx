title: 'Search service'
description: 'Extract live results from popular search engines'
---

## Usage

The search service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search**. Searches are performed in real time by default
or can be queued up for [later retrieval](#asynchronous-mode). Real-time searches take an average of
a few seconds but may require multiple retries, in which case up to **120 seconds** is allocated per
API request.

### Authentication

You can access the service by including
[your secret API token](https://partners.joinmassive.com/profile) in an `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer [Insert API token here]
```

Here’s an example request that uses the [common Curl command](https://curl.se/):

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"          \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search?terms=foo'
```

### Search parameters

Required and optional parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
The keys and values that Massive supports are as follows:

| Key           | Required | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terms`       | ✅       | The broad or exact word or phrase to query (e.g., `foo bar baz` or `"foo bar baz"`); the terms require [form or URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding) (with any space character being replaced by a `+` character or `%20` sequence)          |
| `serps`       | ⬜       | The number of results pages to retrieve, from `1` to `15` inclusive; `1` is the default count                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `engine`      | ⬜       | The search engine to use, `google`, `bing`, or `duckduckgo`; `google` is the default engine                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `device`      | ⬜       | **[Google only]** The name as returned by the [devices endpoint](#device-emulation) of the device to emulate searching on (these names are case insensitive but required to include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); device emulation is unused by default             |
| `country`     | ⬜       | The [two-letter ISO code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code) of the country to search from (these codes are case insensitive); a random country will be used by default                                                                                                             |

| `city`        | ⬜       | The [commonly spelled name](https://www.geonames.org/) of the city in the (prerequisite) country to search from (these names are temporarily case sensitive and required to include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); a random city will be used by default             |
| `uule`        | ⬜       | **[Google only]** The [proprietary encoded string](https://moz.com/blog/geolocation-the-ultimate-tip-to-emulate-local-search) for emulating the location to search from; if possible, the actual location will be searched from not emulated; location emulation is unused by default     |
| `language`    | ⬜       | **[Google only]** The [commonly spelled name or Google code](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) of the language to search in (these names and codes are case insensitive but required to include form- or URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks); English is the default language |
| `mode`        | ⬜       | The synchronous or asynchronous timing of when to retrieve results, `sync` or `async` (see [details below](#asynchronous-mode)); `sync` is the default mode                                                                                                                               |
| `format`      | ⬜       | The format to output to, `html` or `json` (see [details below](#response-format)); `html` is the default format                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `expiration`  | ⬜       | The maximum age of cached results in days to accept, where `0` will disable caching; `1` is the default number of days                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `subaccount`  | ⬜       | Any unique identifier of up to 255 characters (regardless of character encoding); Massive will bill requests made from subaccounts separately                                                                                                                                             |

### Device emulation

The `device` parameter (which is currently limited to Google searches) lets you fetch
device-specific results. For a list of supported devices, make a request with your API token and no
parameters to **https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/devices**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"        \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/devices'
```

The response will be an alphabetized JSON array of device names:

```json
[
  "Blackberry PlayBook",
  "Blackberry PlayBook landscape",
  "BlackBerry Z30",
  "[Remaining device names here]"
]
```

### Asynchronous mode

A request that includes the `mode=async` key-value pair will be satisfied asynchronously:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                     \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search?terms=foo&mode=async'
```

The API will return JSON that contains a job identifier:

```json
{ "id": "1851dab8-4619-409f-893f-47dd3a180bc3" }
```

The job results or status can be requested at any time thereafter by passing a token and the
identifier to **https://&#8203;beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/results**:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASSIVE_API_TOKEN"                                                \
          'https://beta.api.joinmassive.com/search/results?id=1851dab8-4619-409f-893f-47dd3a180bc3'
```

If the results are ready, they’ll be returned in the
[same format as synchronous results](#response-format); otherwise, a JSON status message will be
returned.

A `retrieving` status indicates that the search is in progress:

```json
{ "status": "retrieving" }
```

A `failed` status indicates that the search was unsuccessful and the request should be retried:

```json
{ "status": "failed" }
```

### Response format

You can receive search results in their original HTML or as structured JSON.

#### HTML

Google and Bing don’t feature infinite scrolling, so if you request more than one results page from
those search engines, the HTML of each page will be separated from the next by an empty line
(`\n\n`).

#### JSON

If you set the output to JSON, your results will be parsed into nested objects as in the following
example:

```json
{
               "query": "foo",
  "approxResultsCount": 286000000,
        "resultsCount": 26,
