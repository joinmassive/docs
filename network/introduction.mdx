## About us

The network includes more than 1,000,000 residential computers and devices in more than 195 countries around the world. 100% of these computers and devices have been explicitly opted in by users through the [Massive SDK](https://www.joinmassive.com/getpaid) for app developers, which is designed to maintain user-friendly limits on processing, storage, and bandwidth usage.

## Getting started

The first step to using Massive Network is making sure your credentials work with a simple curl request.
