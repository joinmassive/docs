# Getting started

Weâ€™ll use `curl` for our API call examples. You could also consider a dedicated tool for developing API requests (like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)).

# Authenticate

<Info>
  The API key for the Reporting API is automatically enabled with access to the Residential Proxy.
</Info>


```bash
curl --location 'https://api-network.joinmassive.com/reporting/v1/usage' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: {PROXY_PASSWORD}'
```
