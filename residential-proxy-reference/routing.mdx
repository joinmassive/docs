Massive accepts extended user IDs that let you add targeting specifications to requests. Append a standard URL query string with routing parameters to your proxy username. You can combine routing parameters in any order.

## Standard syntax

Our proxy protocol uses `-` syntax to append routing parameters, which will used throughout our documentation.

```bash
curl -x https://network.joinmassive.com:65535 \
     -U '{PROXY_USERNAME}:{API_KEY}-country-US-zipcode-10001' \
     https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace
```

## Alternative syntax

The alternative syntax `?` + `=` + `&` is also supported.

```bash
curl -x https://network.joinmassive.com:65535 \
     -U '{PROXY_USERNAME}:{API_KEY}?country=US&zipcode=10001' \
     https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace
