You can tune the request by providing geo parameters like an [ISO ZIP code, subdivision, and country code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search), and by [city](https://www.geonames.org/).

```bash
curl -x https://network.joinmassive.com:65535 \
     -U '{PROXY_USERNAME}:{API_KEY}-country-US-zipcode-10001' \

## Country, subdivision, city, zipcode

| Key         | Value                                                                                                                                    | Examples          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| country     | A two-letter country code (these codes are case insensitive)                                                                             | US, UK            |
| subdivision | The alphanumeric second part (proceeding the separator) of a first-level subdivision code in the (prerequisite) country (case insensitive) | CA, LND           |
| city        | A commonly spelled city name (temporarily case sensitive and inclusive of URL-encoded spaces and punctuation marks) in the (prerequisite) country | New York, London  |
| zipcode     | A postal code. Please take a look at the limitations below.                                                                               | 10001, OX2        |

## Geotargeting rules

- `country` key must always persist if any of the geo parameters is specified. Otherwise, HTTP 400 is returned.
- If more than one geo key is specified, the server finds an appropriate node strictly matching all the parameters. The only exception is `zipcode`: if specified, `city` key is ignored.
  - **Details**:
    - If both subdivision and zipcode are provided, the city is ignored.
    - If both zipcode and city are provided, the city is ignored.
    - If subdivision and city are provided, both are strictly matched.

_Please, take into account, that due to technical reasons, the more strict geotargeting narrows the range of appropriate nodes._

## Zipcode Notes

For the following countries, we accept partial postal codes with the number of characters indicated below:

- **United States**: 5
- **Canada**: 3
- **United Kingdom**: 2-4
- **Brazil**: 5
- **Ireland**: 3
- **Japan**: 7 (specified for the first 6. The last digit defaults to 1)
- **Netherlands**: 4
- **Portugal**: 7 (accurate for the first 4. The last 3 often default to -001)
- **Singapore**: 2

Geotargeting by country and city is always more robust than by ZIP code.
