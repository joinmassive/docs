# General Restrictions
- UDP communication isn’t allowed.
- Ports other than the standard `80` and `443` are blocked; `http://example.com/` and `https://example.com/` are acceptable targets, for example, but `http://example.com:8080` would be rejected.
- The Massive Network is intended to optimize delivery of content that could be reasonably considered “family friendly” to a (currently) worldwide userbase (in the future, regional distinctions are planned), so potentially dangerous or offensive content isn’t allowed.

A request that’s blocked due to any of these protocol, port, or content restrictions will fail with a `452` Disallowed Content error message.

# Restricted Domains
- We restrict access to content that is generally used to evade the law or site TOS policies. If you are getting blocked from accessing certain content that you have a legitimate reason to access, then contact support to complete our KYC process to gain access.

# Port 25
- `Port 25` cannot be opened on our residential proxy network. If you want to use residential proxies to test email sending, you can request access for `Port 587` or `Port 465`.

# Request access

 Contact [support@joinmassive.com](support@joinmassive.com) if you have questions about our policies or want to complete KYC to gain access to content that is restricted by default.
