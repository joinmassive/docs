The response depends on the error code:

- 500 (Internal Server Error):
  - Wait a few minutes and retry
  - Contact support if persistent

- 502 (Bad Gateway):
  - Check if routing parameters are too restrictive 
  - Try again as it might be temporary node unavailability

- 503 (Service Unavailable):
  - Review geotargeting specifications
  - Try during lower demand periods
