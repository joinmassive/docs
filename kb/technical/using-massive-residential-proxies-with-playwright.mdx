title: "Using Massive Residential Proxies with Playwright"
---

The playwright supports both synchronous and asynchronous scraping. Here's an asynchronous example:

### Step 1: Install Playwright

Run:

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install
```

### Step 2: Code Example

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    proxy = {
        "server": "https://network.joinmassive.com:65535",
        "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
    }

    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(proxy=proxy, headless=True)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://httpbin.io/ip")
        content = await page.content()
        print(content)
        await browser.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Invalid Proxy Credentials**:
   - Ensure your username and password match the Massive dashboard credentials.

2. **Connection Refused**:
   - Verify the protocol (`http` or `https`) and port (`65534` or `65535`).

3. **SSL Certificate Errors**:
   - For headless browsers, configure them to ignore SSL certificate issues.

4. **IP Rotation Settings**:
   - Adjust Sticky TTL in the Massive dashboard to control how often IPs rotate.

5. **Outdated Library Versions**:

Ensure libraries like `requests`, `puppeteer`, or `playwright` are up-to-date.
