Here's how you can integrate them with Node.js using Axios.

### Step 1: Install Axios

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Navigate to your project directory and install Axios using the following command:

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Step 2: Get Your Proxy Credentials

Log in to the Massive dashboard and navigate to the **Profile** section to find your username, password, and proxy domain. Your proxy URL should follow this format:

```
https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_PASSWORD>@network.joinmassive.com:65535
```

Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` with your Massive credentials.

### Step 3: Make Requests with Massive Residential Proxies

Here's an example of using Axios with Massive proxies to send a request to `httpbin.io/ip`, which returns the IP address used for the request.

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

// Proxy credentials
const proxy = {
    protocol: 'https',
    host: 'network.joinmassive.com',
    port: '65535',
    auth: {
        username: '<YOUR_PROXY_USERNAME>',
        password: '<YOUR_PROXY_PASSWORD>'
    }
};

// Target URL
const targetURL = 'https://httpbin.io/ip';

// Axios instance with SSL verification disabled
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
    proxy: proxy,
    httpsAgent: new (require('https').Agent)({
        rejectUnauthorized: false // Disable SSL verification
    })
});

// Make the request
axiosInstance.get(targetURL)
    .then(response => {
        console.log('Your IP Address:', response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
    });
```

### Troubleshooting Common Errors

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

### 1. Invalid Proxy Credentials

- If you see a `407 Proxy Authentication Required` or `401 Unauthorized` error, ensure your username and password in the `auth` section match the credentials in the Massive dashboard.

### 2. Outdated Axios Version

- Older Axios versions might not support all proxy configurations. Update Axios to the latest version using: `npm install axios@latest`

### 3. Connection Refused or Blocked

- Verify that you're using the correct protocol (`http` or `https`) and port (`65534` or `65535`).
- Check if the target website is blocking proxies. Some websites implement advanced anti-bot mechanisms.

### 4. Invalid Proxy URL Format

- The proxy URL must be correctly formatted: `<http://username:password@proxy-host>:port`
- Ensure no component is missing or incorrectly configured.

### 5. IP Rotation Issues

If IPs are not rotating as expected, check the **Sticky TTL** settings on Massive. Lower the TTL value to rotate IPs more frequently.
