When combining targeting parameters:

1. Mandatory Requirements:
   - Country parameter is always required
   - Additional parameters must be valid for the specified country

2. Parameter Hierarchy:
   - ZIP/Postal code takes precedence over city
   - Subdivision and city must match when both are used

3. Impact Considerations:
   - More specific targeting reduces available proxy nodes
   - Start with broad parameters and narrow as needed
