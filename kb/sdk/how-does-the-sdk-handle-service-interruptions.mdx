---

Each platform provides service recovery mechanisms:

### Android/Fire OS

- You can **optionally** set a callback when calling the `init` method
- This callback will receive the **initial service state** after initialization
- To check the service state later, the user must call the `state` method manually

### Windows

- You can set callbacks for service availability:
  - `MassiveSetServiceUnavailableCallback` (when the service becomes unavailable)
  - `MassiveSetServiceAvailableCallback` (when the service becomes available)
- You can also set callbacks to track service start/stop events triggered from the **service UI** instead of the app UI:
  - `MassiveStartedViaTaskbarCallback` (when started from the service UI)
  - `MassiveStoppedViaTaskbarCallback` (when stopped from the service UI)

### iOS

- You **must** set a callback when calling the `initAsync` method.
- This callback will receive the **initial service state** after initialization.
- To check the service state later, the user must call the `getStatus` method manually.
