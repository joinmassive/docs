No, the SDK is designed to operate with minimal impact by using only free/unused device resources.

### Android/Fire OS:

- Uses idle device resources and runs as a separate process to avoid interfering with the main application.
- When using Foreground Service, users are kept aware of resource usage through notifications

### iOS:

- Background processing only occurs when the device is charging to preserve battery life
- No special capabilities are required that might impact performance

### Windows:

- Runs as a separate process to avoid interfering with the main application.
- Users are notified of resource usage through the system tray notifications.

The SDK implements these battery and performance optimizations:

1. User control over participation
2. Option to use Background Service mode for less resource usage (Android/Fire OS)
3. Separate process architecture (Android/Fire OS/Windows)
4. Charging-only background processing (iOS)
