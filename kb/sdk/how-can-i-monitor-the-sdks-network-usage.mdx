title: "How can I monitor the SDK's network usage?"
---

Each platform provides network usage tracking:

- **Android/Fire OS:** Use the `usage()` method in MassiveClient
- **Windows:** Use taskbar usage display functionality  
- **iOS:** Use `MassiveClient.shared.getNetworkUsage()`

The usage is reported in bytes and can be monitored for resource management.
