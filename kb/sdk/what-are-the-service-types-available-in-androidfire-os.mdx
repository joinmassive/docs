1. Foreground Service:
   - More visible with customizable notification
   - Higher earning potential
   - Less likely to be killed by the system
   - Requires notification configuration

2. Background Service:
   - Runs silently
   - Less intrusive
   - No visible notification
   - May be more likely to be terminated by the system
