title: "How can I check if a device is compatible with the SDK?"
---

Check against platform requirements:

- Android and Fire OS: SDK Level 21+ (Lollipop or later)
- Windows: [Check documentation](https://docs.joinmassive.com/monetization-sdk/desktop-windows) for specific requirements
- iOS: iOS 16.0 or later

The SDK will return appropriate error states if the device is incompatible.
