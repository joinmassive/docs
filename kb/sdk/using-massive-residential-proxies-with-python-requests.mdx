### Step 1: Install Required Library

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed. Run:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 2: Configure Proxy

Retrieve your Massive credentials (username and password) from the **Profile** section of the dashboard. Format your proxy URL as:

```
https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_PASSWORD>@network.joinmassive.com:65535
```

### Step 3: Code Example

The following Python script demonstrates how to send requests through Massive Residential Proxies:

```python
import requests

# Construct the proxy URL
proxy_url = "https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_PASSWORD>@network.joinmassive.com:65535"

# Set up proxies for requests
proxies = {
    "http": proxy_url,
    "https": proxy_url,
}

# Send a request through the proxy
try:
    response = requests.get("https://httpbin.io/ip", proxies=proxies)
    print(response.text)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
```
