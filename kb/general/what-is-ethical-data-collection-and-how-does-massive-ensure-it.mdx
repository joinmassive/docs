title: "What is ethical data collection and how does Massive ensure it?"

Ethical data collection means gathering data responsibly, respecting website terms of service, and using fair scraping practices like appropriate request rates. It also involves using proxies that are ethically sourced.

At Massive, we provide **100% ethically sourced residential proxies**. Every participant in our network gives explicit consent and opts in willingly. We ensure transparency by showing clear consent dialogs so everyone understands and agrees to the permissions they provide.
