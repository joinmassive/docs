Welcome to partnering with Massive! We use [Bill.com](http://Bill.com) to issue our invoices, here's a quick guide on how to access and pay your invoices for the first time.

1. **Check Your Email:** You will get an invoice sent to the email on file with [Bill.com](http://Bill.com). This email will include a link to view and pay your invoice.

2. **Click the Link:** Click on the link in the email. This will take you to a secure page where you can view the invoice details.

3. **Create an Account (if needed):** If this is your first time using [Bill.com](http://Bill.com), you may need to create a free account. This is a simple process that requires your email address and a password.

4. **View Your Invoice:** Once you've logged into your account, you'll be able to see the invoice. You can download or print it for your records.

5. **Make a Payment:** If you're ready to pay, you can do so directly through [Bill.com](http://Bill.com) using various payment methods. You can also save a credit card on file that will automatically be charged on your due date.
