## Usage

**{companyName}'s** search service delivers all organic and paid Google results reliably, as
structured or raw data. The service has a RESTful interface that accepts `GET` requests at
**https://&zwj;{apiEndpoint}/search**.

Searches can be localized with <Link href='whitelabel/geotargeting'>geotargeting parameters</Link>.
They're performed live by default or optionally queued for <Link
href='whitelabel/scheduling'>subsequent retrieval</Link>. Live searches take an average of a few
seconds but may require multiple retries, in which case up to **120 seconds** is allocated per API
call.

search parameters can be added in a
[standard query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).

### Response format

Search results are returned as rendered HTML or structured JSON.

#### HTML

If you request multiple results pages that don't feature infinite scrolling, the HTML of each page
will be separated from the next by an empty line (`\n\n`).

#### JSON

If you set the output to JSON, your results will be parsed into nested objects.
